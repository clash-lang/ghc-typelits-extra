* Reduce `LCM 0 x` to `0` [#9](https://github.com/clash-lang/ghc-typelits-extra/issues/9)
* Reduce `LCM 1 x` to `x` [#9](https://github.com/clash-lang/ghc-typelits-extra/issues/9)
* Reduce `LCM x x` to `x` [#9](https://github.com/clash-lang/ghc-typelits-extra/issues/9)

  * Solver turns LCM into GCD [#8](https://github.com/clash-lang/ghc-typelits-extra/issues/8)
  * Solver turns Max into Min

# 0.2.2 *January 15th 2017*
* Reduce `Min n (n+1)` to `n`
* Reduce `Max n (n+1)` to `n+1`
* Reduce cases like `1 <=? Div 18 6` to `True`
* Add a type-level division that rounds up: `type DivRU n d = Div (n + (d - 1)) d`
* Add a type-level `divMod` : `DivMod :: Nat -> Nat -> '(Nat, Nat)`

# 0.2.1 *September 29th 2016*
